## Your Project Structure

Inside of your Website Template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── content
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── content
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── content
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── content
│   └── pages/
│       └── content
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` Will be where you find most of what makes up the landing page.

There are a few images & assets provided to get you started which are stored in the `src/` directory.

## 📋 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
